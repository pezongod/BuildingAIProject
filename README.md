# No Negativity

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Create an ai to identify and stop negative/insulting/demeaning comments on social media.
If you implement it on your account it should remove all negative comments but save the positive ones.


## Background

In social media today there is a lot of hate and trolling going around and it is so bad in fact that people get mental health issues over it.
I believe that my AI can help in this, to only allow positive and constructive comments meant to help and encourage the content producer.

## How is it used?

It would be implemented by the social media plattforms, such as Facebook, instagram, TikTok etc, and as the user you get the option to use its feature from the settings panel. 
Turn it on to stop getting negetive feedback and hate.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data will harvested from the social media plattforms to get the best/ most accurate data possible. The data will be used to train the ai in recognizing unwanted comments and stop them.
AI technologies: Supervised training, NLP, RNN

## Challenges

The biggest challange with this is getting the social media tech giants to want this. Their algoritms is designed in a way that promotes emotions and comments with hateful and negative meaning tend to actually increase its popularity and create click rockets!
So there is a possibility the tech companies actually do not want this feature.

## What next?

To get interested developers to help create the algorithmÂ´s needed and to reach out to social media plattform owners to pitch the idea.
